      <description>The scikit-learn Iris data-set consists of 3 (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) species (50 samples per species, for a total of 150 samples) of the iris flower. Each sample has four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. Given these measurements a machine learning model can predict the iris specie with a high degree of accuracy. Here I demonstrate a machine learning web application using Python, Scikit-Learn machine learning library and Flask web framework.</description>

      <description>I have just completed Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialisation course by deeplearning.ai available through Coursera. This is my summary and opinion of the course offering. The specialisation consists of 5 courses and it is suggested that they be completed in 3 months by devoting 11 hours per week. It really depends on your previous knowledge, experience and how quickly you can grasp the concepts. When stuck with the assignments and concepts I found the forum to be very helpful.</description>
