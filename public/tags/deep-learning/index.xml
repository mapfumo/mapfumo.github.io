      <description>I have just completed Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s Deep Learning Specialisation course by deeplearning.ai available through Coursera. This is my summary and opinion of the course offering. The specialisation consists of 5 courses and it is suggested that they be completed in 3 months by devoting 11 hours per week. It really depends on your previous knowledge, experience and how quickly you can grasp the concepts. When stuck with the assignments and concepts I found the forum to be very helpful.</description>
