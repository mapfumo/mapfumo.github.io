      <description>In the dynamic realm of software development, the pursuit of effective problem-solving methodologies is ceaseless. One approach gaining increasing recognition is Design Science, a disciplined methodology that seamlessly blends scientific inquiry and practical application. In this blog post, I delve into the importance of Design Science in the context of software development, focusing on its disciplined and systematic nature.
Understanding Design Science Design Science, as articulated by Johannesson and Perjons, revolves around the scientific exploration and creation of artifacts aimed at addressing real-world issues of general interest.</description>

      <description>The scikit-learn Iris data-set consists of 3 (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) species (50 samples per species, for a total of 150 samples) of the iris flower. Each sample has four measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. Given these measurements a machine learning model can predict the iris specie with a high degree of accuracy. Here I demonstrate a machine learning web application using Python, Scikit-Learn machine learning library and Flask web framework.</description>

      <description>Go or GoLang is an open source statically typed language that was created at Google by Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer, and Ken Thompson. It first appeared in Nov 2009 and has been rapidly gaining in popularity. Some of the language&amp;rsquo;s highlights include clean and highly accessible syntax, garbage collection, amazing native concurrency, fast compilation speed, excellent tooling, builtin documentation, good cross-platform support, ORM (Object-relational mapping ) library called GORM and excellent support for micro-services.</description>
