      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have just completed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/instructor/andrewng&#34;&gt;Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning&#34;&gt;Deep Learning Specialisation&lt;/a&gt; course by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deeplearning.ai/&#34;&gt;deeplearning.ai&lt;/a&gt; available through &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/2WjYrPB&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;. This is my summary and opinion of the course offering. The specialisation consists of 5 courses and it is suggested that they be completed in 3 months by devoting 11 hours per week. It really depends on your previous knowledge, experience and how quickly you can grasp the concepts. When stuck with the assignments and concepts I found the forum to be very helpful. I found the assignments to reasonably difficult. The only thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t like is that by forcing you to complete the given code (complete missing blanks) you are a bit constrained. For example it would be nice to state the function signature and leave it to the student to implement it in their own way. The good thing is that one can always make such suggestions through the forums. The courses don&amp;rsquo;t have to be completed in any particular order but I found it more helpful to follow the suggested order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The IEC 61850 is at the heart of data communications in the smart grid. The IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) 61850 standard outlines a framework for communication between several single devices in the power system. The standard was designed to separate the data model from method of communication, address the importance of a structured approach to the design of substation automation systems, utilise existing technologies like Ethernet and TCP/IP, simplify system configuration, device measurement sharing and to enable vendor independence. Although the scope of the IEC 61850 standard was originally substation focussed applications are already operating on wide area substation-to-substation communication using various components of IEC 61850.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
