Welcome to my blog! I'm Antony, a data communications professional with a passion for Applied Blockchain technologies and software development. I'm also a huge fan of [Arsenal football club](https://www.arsenal.com/), and I'm passionate about renewable energy and open-source software.

Through this platform, I'll be sharing my research journey into blockchain applications and offering insights on topics related to distributed systems and software development. I'll be diving deep into [Go](http://golang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I was initially drawn to Go because of its simplicity and efficiency, which make it an excellent choice for building fast, scalable applications. Meanwhile, I'm continually impressed by Python's versatility and ability to handle a wide variety of programming tasks with ease. As for Rust, I started learning it out of curiosity, despite its steep learning curve. However, with each project I undertake, I become more comfortable with its unique syntax and discover new ways to leverage its speed and safety features. I'll be sharing my efforts on [GitHUb](https://github.com/mapfumo) where this site is also hosted.

If you're interested in staying up-to-date with the latest developments in these fields, then make sure to check back regularly. I'm excited to share my knowledge and learn from your feedback along the way!
