![Antony Mapfumo](/img/ants.jpg#floatleft "Antony Mapfumo")

I'm Antony — a network engineer currently focused on **Industrial IoT (IIoT)** and **embedded systems**. My work centres on building reliable, efficient, and purpose-driven technology using tools such as **Embedded Rust/C++**, **STM32 microcontrollers**, **LoRa/LoRaWAN**, and **industrial communication protocols**.

This blog documents my journey into IIoT engineering: from working with sensors, microcontrollers, and logic analyzers to designing deterministic, energy-aware systems. My aim is to make complex technical topics clear, practical, and grounded in real-world engineering.

You'll find concise explanations, hands-on experiments, and insights from the intersection of communications, embedded development, and distributed industrial systems. All related projects and code are shared on my GitHub: **https://github.com/mapfumo**.

Thanks for visiting — I hope you find something here that informs or inspires your own engineering journey.
