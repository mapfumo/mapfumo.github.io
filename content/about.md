Welcome to my blog! I'm Antony, a data communications professional, with interest in distributed systems, machine learning, renewable energy, open source software, design science research, and software development. I'm also a huge fan of [Arsenal football club](https://www.arsenal.com/).

I've been captivated by [Golang](http://golang.org) for nearly a decade, ever since my first encounter with it. What drew me to Go was its elegant simplicity and efficiency, making it a stellar choice for crafting rapid and scalable applications. Go's innate support for concurrency, exceptional performance, and the expansive ecosystem it provides for constructing distributed systems aligns seamlessly with my passion.

The allure of Golang lies in its ability to promote optimal coding practices, rendering it relatively accessible, especially for those well-versed in Python. With its lightweight goroutines and the seamless handling of concurrent tasks, Golang eliminates the complexity typically associated with traditional multithreading, making it a compelling choice for me.

In the forthcoming blog entries, I'm eager to share my Golang journey and how it intertwines with my fervor for distributed systems. Together, we'll delve into the language's various facets, explore its libraries, and delve into its application in constructing high-performance, distributed solutions. I aim to showcase why Golang stands as an exceptional choice for those venturing into the realm of distributed systems. I'll be sharing my efforts on [GitHUb](https://github.com/mapfumo) where this site is also hosted.

If you're interested in staying up-to-date with the latest developments in these fields, then make sure to check back regularly. I'm excited to share my knowledge and learn from your feedback along the way!
