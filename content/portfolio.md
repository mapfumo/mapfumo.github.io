### Communication requirements for enabling real-time energy trading among distributed energy storage systems and aggregators

Abstract — In this paper I propose a model for implementing a real-time energy bidding and trading system among distributed battery energy storage systems (D-BESS) and aggregators.
Energy bidding and trading process flow will be discussed. A message passing mechanism as way to meet the real-time communications requirements of a system based on a suggested model is outlined. The importance of distributed energy resources (DER) and the role aggregators play in the model is
also discussed. An overview of possible network architectures
and protocols are introduced. Index Terms – Distributed Battery Storage Systems, BESS,
Smart grid, Real-time energy trading, Energy Bidding, BESS, Distributed Energy Resources (DER)

### A Unified Logging System

Abstract — Australia Post operates optical character recognition based mail sorting machines. Occasionally they have faults which vary in severity. These faults are logged and sent to a central server for analysis. This project focussed on developing tools to allow technicians and managers to view and analyse these faults in an intuitive manner with the aim of using this information to improve mail delivery service and reduce costs along the way.
