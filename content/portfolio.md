### Communication requirements for enabling real-time energy trading among distributed energy storage systems and aggregators

**Abstract** — In this paper I propose a model for implementing a real-time energy bidding and trading system among distributed battery energy storage systems (D-BESS) and aggregators.
Energy bidding and trading process flow will be discussed. A message passing mechanism as way to meet the real-time communications requirements of a system based on a suggested model is outlined. The importance of distributed energy resources (DER) and the role aggregators play in the model is
also discussed. An overview of possible network architectures
and protocols are introduced. Index Terms – Distributed Battery Storage Systems, BESS,
Smart grid, Real-time energy trading, Energy Bidding, BESS, Distributed Energy Resources (DER)

### Realtime communications for the distributed control of energy systems ###

**Abstract** - When it comes to selling electricity back to the grid prosumers who have invested in renew-
able electricity generation sources like solar panels face two main constraints, unfavourable
pricing and access to affordable associated battery storage systems. One solution to the first
problem is for the regulating authorities to set better feed in tariffs. This research proposes
an alternative solution, a real-time market based energy bidding and trading between aggre-
gators and prosumers. Instead of prosumers interacting directing with energy companies this
research proposes the use aggregators who act as contract brokers between energy companies
and prosumers. A framework is proposed that includes appropriate network protocols, network
services, a suitable network architecture, a messaging system, applications and algorithms to
allow energy bidding and trading between aggregators and prosumers. The research significance
is substantial original contribution towards further reduction in greenhouse emissions by having
a system that allows more renewable energy source participants in electricity generation.

### A Unified Logging System

Abstract — Australia Post operates optical character recognition based mail sorting machines. Occasionally they have faults which vary in severity. These faults are logged and sent to a central server for analysis. This project focussed on developing tools to allow technicians and managers to view and analyse these faults in an intuitive manner with the aim of using this information to improve mail delivery service and reduce costs along the way.

### Cisco NetFlow Collector and Analyser

Abstract — UltraFlow is an application for collecting and analysing Cisco Netflow data. It
is written in Python, wxPython, Matplotlib, SQLite and the Python based Twisted network
programming framework.
A prototype was developed in Python. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mapfumo/netflow)
